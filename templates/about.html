          <h1>Optimizing ICU Management by Predicting Intensive Care Urgency (IC-U)</h1>
          <h2>What is the problem?</h2>
          <p>
            Over 5 million patients annually require some form of intensive care, which requires continual and often invasive 
            monitoring, as well as near 1-to-1 nurse-to-patient staffing in order to treat patients effectively. As a result of 
            the complicated nature of ICU care, ICUs are one of the leading drivers of hospital costs in the US today. Hospitals 
            are currently spending $80B a year in ICU care, and these costs are expected to double by 2030. It is no surprise then 
            that the operating cost of maintaining an intensive care unit is a major pain point for hospitals across the country and 
            that innovations are necessary to help drive costs down.
          </p>
          <h2>My solution</h2>
          <p>
            The basis of IC-U is to quantify a risk value (called the "IC-U" factor) reflecting intensive care urgency for patients 
            that present to a hospital. My solution would take in a patientâ€™s health and demographic information and estimate the 
            likelihood that s/he may need immediate intensive care. Additionally, it will ouput potential interventions that may 
            reduce this risk.
          </p>
          <h2>Value proposition</h2>
          <p>
            On an individual basis, quantifying intensive care urgency will allow hospitals to identify those patients most likely in 
            need of intensive care sooner and suggest potential interventions that may reduce this urgency.
          </p>    
          <p>
            At an aggregate level, the ability to classify patients by apparent intensive care urgency will provide hospitals the ability
            to optimize patient triaging and monitoring and better manage and predict ICU capacity. Combined, all of these benefits would
            lead to decreases in mortality and morbidity, reductions in ICU stays and stay durations, potentially more streamlined ICU staffing,
            and ultimately reductions in operating costs.
          </p>
          <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>IC-U works as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hospital staff inputs patient information into a web form</li>
                <li>
                    Upon submission, the predictive model analyzes the patient data and compute a risk factor that quantifies the "urgency"
                    that this patient will need intensive care. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, the app displays the results with a description of the main contributors to the IC-U factor, and potential 
                    interventions that may be associated with a reduction in the risk factor.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As more information for a patient is gathered, the inputs can be updated and a new IC-U factor can be calculated and displayed as needed.
            </p>
